 How data versioning tools impact ML systemsâ€™ evolution from a bug analysis perspective

## Description

AI-based software systems like DVC have been reported to have introduced the use of data versioning tools.
In this project we studied the effect of using DVC tool from a bug analysis point of view.

## Methodology

* Mining github dvc projects 
* Analysis of the files present on the changes from bug-labeled Github issues solutions and bugfix-related commits
* Check the number of modified lines in each type of bug fixes for the commits analysis.
* Compare the time to resolution and number of comments for issues related to dvc to the general scenario.
* Manual analysis of the DVC-related bugs resolutions checking for the DVC files modifications
* Result analysis and validation
