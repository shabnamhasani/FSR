# FSR
Automated Classification of Requirements-related Provisions in Food-safety Regulations

## Description

In this paper, we present two contributions aimed at enhancing food-safety classification. First, we propose a conceptual characterization of food-safety concepts that are closely related to system and software requirements. Second, we develop a BERT-based approach for automatically classifying legal provisions based on these requirements-related food-safety concepts. We conduct an empirical evaluation of our classification approach, using various BERT variants such as BERT large, RoBERTa, and ALBERT, as well as non-transformer models such as BiLSTM and Keyword Search. 
An overview of the approache are discussed below:

* Pre-processing: Sentence splitting and context preservation
* LM-based Classification: Employing fine-tuned Language Models for each to predict whether or not a given input provision has some occurrence of concepts.
* Keyword-based Classification: Identifying too sparse concepts with the keywords listed in https://github.com/shabnamhasani/FSR/tree/main/Data
* Label Prediction: producing the final label recommendations for each provision. 


## Content description
* Code: contains scripts related to the implementation of all the approaches discussed in this study. The folder is divided into three subfolders: RQ1, RQ2, and Supplementary Code.

    * RQ1: contains code related to the BERT-based Language Models implemented for answering RQ1 and the prerequisite packages in the requirement.txt file.
    * RQ2: contains code for BiLSTM and Keyword Search baseline models, as well as the prerequisite packages specified in the requirement.txt file.
    * Supplementary: contains subsidiary codes that support the main analyses presented in this study. This includes scripts for Food Safety Sentence Statistics (retrieves the content of food safety-related URLs and calculates various statistics on the number of sentences found in them, such as the mean, standard deviation, and other relevant metrics), scripts for Classification Evaluation and Significance Testing (takes classification reports as input and generates a dataframe with precision, recall, and f-score values for each label. It then performs statistical significance testing between two models using the generated dataframe) and Boxplot Visualization (uses the second dataframe generated in the previous notebook to create boxplots showcasing the distribution of results).

* Evaluation Results: contains two subfolder namely RQ1 and RQ2. 
    * RQ1: contains Precision, Recall and F-Score for the BERT variants classification results, model hyperparameters, statistical significance tests of comparing BERT base approach against these BERT variants along with dfboxplots folder containing BERT variants dataframes used for visualization.
    
    * RQ2: includes BiLSTM hyperparameters, statistical significance tests of comparing our approach against baselines, and dfboxplots folder containing baseline dataframes used for visualization.
    
* Data: contains datasets including qualitative data derived from qualitative coding and evaluation data annotated by third-part annotators.

### Instructions to run the proposed algorithms

* Create a python environment with the packages listed in: FSR/Code/RQ1/Requirement.txt
* Open the environment and proceed to FSR main folder FSR/Code/RQ1 and execute the code BERTbase.py
