Automated Classification of Requirements-related Provisions in Food-safety Regulations

## Description

In this paper, we propose to develop 1) a conceptual characterization of food-safety concepts that closely relate to systems and software requirements and 2) a BERT-based approach to automatically classify legal provisions according to requirements-related food-safety concepts. We empirically evaluate our classification approach with BERT variants, e.g., BERT large, RoBERTa, ALBERT and non-transformer models including: BiLSTM and Keyword Search.
An overview of the approaches are discussed below:
