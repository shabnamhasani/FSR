Automated Classification of Requirements-related Provisions in Food-safety Regulations

## Description

In this paper, we propose to develop 1) a conceptual characterization of food-safety concepts that closely relate to systems and software requirements and 2) a BERT-based approach to automatically classify legal provisions according to requirements-related food-safety concepts. We empirically evaluate our classification approach with BERT variants, e.g., BERT large, RoBERTa, ALBERT and non-transformer models including: BiLSTM and Keyword Search.

## Methodology

* Mining github dvc projects 
* Analysis of the files present on the changes from bug-labeled Github issues solutions and bugfix-related commits
* Check the number of modified lines in each type of bug fixes for the commits analysis.
* Compare the time to resolution and number of comments for issues related to dvc to the general scenario.
* Manual analysis of the DVC-related bugs resolutions checking for the DVC files modifications
* Result analysis and validation
